This projects attempts to duplicate this analysis by prof. Damodaran:

[Inflation and Investing: False Alarm or Fair Warning?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vqmjgF3E4)

I thought it might be interesting to be able to get the latest data whenever we need to perform this analysis in the future.

Data source locations:

- Inflation: https://www.quandl.com/data/RATEINF/CPI_USA-Consumer-Price-Index-USA (need to sign up for an account to download)
- T-Bond: [Damodaran Online: Historical Returns on Stocks, Bonds and Bills](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html) (I could not find a larger data source than the one in prof. Damodaran's website so I used it)
- Gold: [Gold Prices Dataset from Gold Hub](https://www.gold.org/goldhub/data/gold-prices) (need to sign up for an account to download)
- S&P 500 and Real Estate: [ONLINE DATA ROBERT SHILLER](http://www.econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm) (Much thanks to Prof. Robert J. Shiller for providing this dataset)

The Markdown report is available in the [report](./report/inflation_research.md) directory (best read from your local computer - on the Github website, the styles for the tables do not display properly since CSS is not supported.).
